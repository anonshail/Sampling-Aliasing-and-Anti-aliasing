# Sampling-Aliasing-and-Anti-aliasing
This is a project in C++ to demonstrated Resampling and Filtering in the spatial and temporal domain. It consists of two parts, the first one aimed to develop your understanding of sampling/aliasing issues in the spatial domain and the second one deals with sampling/aliasing issues in the temporal domain.

This project was undertaken as a part of the CSCI-576 (Multimedia Systems Design) course at USC Viterbi School of Engineering in Spring 2023.
